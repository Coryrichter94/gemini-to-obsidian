## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Takeout export containing Gemini Apps data

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `tqdm` - Progress bars
- `ijson` - Streaming JSON parsing
- `html2text` - HTML to markdown conversion

## Configuration

Edit these variables in `gemini_to_obsidian.py`:

```python
# Path to your unzipped Google Takeout folder
TAKEOUT_ROOT_PATH = 'C:/Users/username/Downloads/Takeout'

# Path to your Obsidian vault import folder
OBSIDIAN_OUTPUT_PATH = 'C:/Users/username/Documents/ObsidianVault/Gemini Imports'

# Additional settings
ORGANIZE_BY_DATE = True  # Create year/month subfolders
DRY_RUN = False         # Set to True to preview without creating files
```

## Getting Google Takeout Data

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Select "Gemini Apps" (and deselect everything else for faster download)
3. Choose format: ZIP, 2GB max file size
4. Download and extract the ZIP file
5. Point `TAKEOUT_ROOT_PATH` to the extracted folder

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversion
```bash
python gemini_to_obsidian.py
```

### Preview Mode (Dry Run)
Set `DRY_RUN = True` in the script to see what would be created without actually writing files.

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG_MODE = True` for detailed logging and troubleshooting.

## Features in Detail

### Smart Title Extraction

- Truncates long titles intelligently at word boundaries
- Uses conversation content as the actual note title

### Automatic Tagging

- Creates clean, Obsidian-compatible tags

### Attachment Processing
- Copies and links images, documents, audio, and video files
- Handles missing attachments gracefully
- Creates appropriate Obsidian embed syntax

### YAML Frontmatter
- Properly escaped titles for YAML compatibility
- ISO timestamp formatting
- Source URL preservation
- Clean tag arrays

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"JSON file not found"**
- Verify your `TAKEOUT_ROOT_PATH` points to the extracted Takeout folder
- Ensure the path contains `My Activity/Gemini Apps/MyActivity.json`

**"No valid Gemini records found"**
- Check that your Takeout export included Gemini Apps data
- Try enabling `DEBUG_MODE` for more detailed logging

**HTML parsing errors**
- The script handles malformed HTML gracefully
- Check the console output for specific error details

### Performance Tips

- Large chat histories may take several minutes to process
- Use `DRY_RUN = True` first to verify settings
- Consider `ORGANIZE_BY_DATE = False` for simpler folder structure
